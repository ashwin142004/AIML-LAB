Agents
An agent is a computer program that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it using actuators 

Ex: 
Human Agent 
Robotic Agent 
Software Agent

An environment is the part of the universe that affects the agent and is affected by the agent 
- Real world
- Digital

What is percept?
- What an agent perceives at a given time 

Sequence 
- History of everything the agent has perceived 
- Helps the agent make informed decisions 
- Can be stored and analysed for future actions

Agent Function
- Maps the percept sequences to actions
- Math Rep: f: P* —> A
	Where 
        - P* => Set of all percepts sequence
        - A => Set of all Actions

How agents make decisions 
- Built in knowledge (Pre programmed rules, AI models)
- Percept Sequence (Past experiences)

*Agents can not act on something that they have not perceived before.


Agent Function vs Agent Program

Function: 
	Abstract mathematical mapping from the percept sequences to the actions 
	Can be represented as a large table listing all possible percepts and corresponding actions

Program: 
	The actual implementation of the agent function 
	Runs within a physical system 

Why is the agent function so large?
- Grows infinitely unless a limit is set on the percept sequence length 

What makes an agent good or bad?
- Efficiency 
- Adaptability 
- Correctness
- Resource Usage


Simple reflex agents 
- A simple reflex agent selects actions based only on the current percept 
- Ignores the History of past percepts 

strengths and limitations 
- fast decision makeing 
- efficient computation
- works well in predictable environments

x No memory 
x fails in complex scenarios
x Limited intelligence
