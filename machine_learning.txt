Machine learning teaches computers to recognize patterns and make decisions automatically using data and algorithms.

It can be broadly categorized into three types:

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.

Well Posed Learning Problem – A computer program is said to learn from experience E in context to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as was measured by P, upgrades with experience E. 

Any problem can be segregated as well-posed learning problem if it has three traits – 

Task
Performance Measure 
Experience 


ex: Autonomous Vehicles
Task – driving on public four-lane highways using sight scanners
Performance Measure – average distance progressed before a fallacy
Experience – order of images and steering instructions noted down while observing a human driver
