Searching Problems 
Thre main components 
    A State Space. Set of all possible states where you can be.
    A Start State. The state from where the search begins.
    A Goal State. A function that looks at the current state returns whether or not it is the goal state.
    
    There are 3 types of goal state
        Single goal state
        Set of goal states 
        property goal state(Goal property)

Two types of searching 
    Informed search - Here, the algorithms have information on the goal state, which helps in more efficient searching. This information is obtained by something called a heuristic. 
        - Best first Search 
        - A* Search
        - Greedy Search

    Uniniformed search - The search algorithms in this section have no additional information on the goal node other than the one provided in the problem definition. 
                        Also called Blind Search
        - DFS 
        - BFS 
        - Uniform Cost Search
